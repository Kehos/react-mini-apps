# Dice roller - A React mini app

This mini app is intended to be a dice roller, where you set up how much faces you want your dice to have and then a button makes rolls, which results are displayed below the button.

## Usage

To roll a die, just press the `Roll` button and the result will appear below.

If you want to set the number of faces of the die, edit the value in the input field and then press `Roll` to roll a new die with the specified faces. The number of faces must be greater than zero.
